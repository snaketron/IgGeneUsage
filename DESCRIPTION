Description: Detection of biases in the usage of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes 
    is an important task in immune repertoire profiling. IgGeneUsage detects 
    aberrant Ig gene usage between biological conditions using a probabilistic 
    model which is analyzed computationally by Bayes inference. With this
    IgGeneUsage also avoids some common problems related to the current 
    practice of null-hypothesis significance testing.
